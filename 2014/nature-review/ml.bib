The whole speaker identification system includes LPCC extraction, SVM training with sequential minimal optimization (SMO), and SVM recognition. The proposed dynamic fixed-point design is applied to each arithmetic procedure and fixed-point error analysis is also performed. The fixed-point SVM-based speaker identification system have been implemented and evaluated on ARM9 DMA2400. The experimental results show that the speaker identification accuracy is slightly degraded with the proposed dynamic fixed-point technique. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

    abstract = {{Multilayer connectionist models of memory based on the encoder model using the backpropagation learning rule are evaluated. The models are applied to standard recognition memory procedures in which items are studied sequentially and then tested for retention. Sequential learning in these models leads to 2 major problems. First, well-learned information is forgotten rapidly as new information is learned. Second, discrimination between studied items and new items either decreases or is nonmonotonic as a function of learning. To address these problems, manipulations of the network within the multilayer model and several variants of the multilayer model were examined, including a model with prelearned memory and a context model, but none solved the problems. The problems discussed provide limitations on connectionist models applied to human memory and in tasks where information to be learned is not all available during learning.}},

Recent efforts to train extremely large networks (with over 1 billion parameters) have relied on cloud-like computing infrastructure and thousands of CPU cores. In this paper, we present technical details and results from our own system based on Commodity Off-The-Shelf High Performance Computing (COTS HPC) technology: a cluster of GPU servers with Infiniband interconnects and MPI. Our system is able to train 1 billion parameter networks on just 3 machines in a couple of days, and we show that it can scale to networks with over 11 billion parameters using just 16 machines. As this infrastructure is much more easily marshaled by others, the approach enables much wider-spread research with extremely large neural networks.}

                 some lessons to be learnt. The Challenge was set up to
                 evaluate the ability of Machine Learning algorithms to
                 provide good à¤¥à¤¤probabilistic predictionsà¤¥à¤¤, rather than
                 just the usual à¤¥à¤¤point predictionsà¤¥à¤¤ with no measure of
                 uncertainty, in regression and classification problems.
                 Parti-cipants had to compete on a number of regression
                 and classification tasks, and were evaluated by both
                 traditional losses that only take into account point
                 predictions and losses we proposed that evaluate the
                 quality of the probabilistic predictions.",

  abstract={Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be incorporated into probabilistic models. In this paper we review some of the approaches which have been proposed to incorporate them into probabilistic models of sequential data, such as hidden Markov models (HMM). We also discuss new developments and new ideas in this area, in particular how ANN can be used to model high-dimensional discrete and continuous data to deal with the curse of dimensionality and how the ideas proposed in these models could be applied to statistical language modeling to represent longer-term context than allowed by trigram models, while keeping word-order information},

  abstract = {Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted {Boltzmann} machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.}

                 is not amenable to stochastic approximation of the
                 gradient. Here we explore ideas from conjugate gradient
                 in the stochastic (online) setting, using fast
                 Hessian-gradient products to set up low-dimensional
                 Krylov subspaces within individual mini-batches. In our
                 benchmark experiments the resulting online learning
                 algorithms converge orders of magnitude faster than
                 ordinary stochastic gradient descent.",

The most widely used algorithms for learning what to put in short-term memory, however, take too much time to be feasible or do not work well at all, especially when minimal time lags between inputs and corresponding teacher signals are long.

  abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of
complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in
vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need {\insist deep
architectures}. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear
operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated
propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the
parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but
learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed
to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art
in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding 
learning algorithms for deep architectures,  in particular those exploiting as
building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted {Boltzmann} Machines,
used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.}

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captures increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered.},

@article{Kohler1992,
    abstract = {The QRS complex is the most striking waveform within the electrocardiogram (ECG). Since it reflects the electrical activity within the heart during the ventricular contraction, the time of its occurrence as well as its shape provide much information about the current state of the heart. Due to its characteristic shape it serves as the basis for the automated determination of the heart rate, as an entry point for classification schemes of the cardiac cycle, and often it is also used in ECG data compression algorithms. In that sense, QRS detection provides the fundamentals for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. Software QRS detection has been a research topic for more than 30 years. The evolution of these algorithms clearly reflects the great advances in computer technology. Within the last decade many new approaches to QRS detection have been proposed; for example, algorithms from the field of artificial neural networks genetic algorithms wavelet transforms, filter banks as well as heuristic methods mostly based on nonlinear transforms. The authors provide an overview of these recent developments as well as of formerly proposed algorithms},

abstract = {The performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) depends critically on how learning rates are tuned and decreased over time. We propose a method to automatically adjust multiple learning rates so as to minimize the expected error at any one time. The method relies on local gradient variations across samples. Using a number of convex and non-convex learning tasks, we show that the resulting algorithm matches the performance of the best settings obtained through systematic search, and effectively removes the need for learning rate tuning.},

        abstract = {{Visual responses of neurons in parietal area 7a are modulated by a combined eye and head position signal in a multiplicative manner. Neurons with multiplicative responses can act as powerful computational elements in neural networks. In the case of parietal cortex, multiplicative gain modulation appears to play a crucial role in the transformation of object locations from retinal to body-centered coordinates. It has proven difficult to uncover single-neuron mechanisms that account for neuronal multiplication. Here we show that multiplicative responses can arise in a network model through population effects. Specifically, neurons in a recurrently connected network with excitatory connections between similarly tuned neurons and inhibitory connections between differently tuned neurons can perform a product operation on additive synaptic inputs. The results suggest that parietal responses may be based on this architecture.}},

	    abstract = {{Motivation: Alternative splicing is a major contributor to cellular diversity in mammalian tissues and relates to many human diseases. An important goal in understanding this phenomenon is to infer a 'splicing code' that predicts how splicing is regulated in different cell types by features derived from RNA, DNA and epigenetic modifiers.Methods: We formulate the assembly of a splicing code as a problem of statistical inference and introduce a Bayesian method that uses an adaptively selected number of hidden variables to combine subgroups of features into a network, allows different tissues to share feature subgroups and uses a Gibbs sampler to hedge predictions and ascertain the statistical significance of identified features.Results: Using data for 3665 cassette exons, 1014 RNA features and 4 tissue types derived from 27 mouse tissues (http://genes.toronto.edu/wasp), we benchmarked several methods. Our method outperforms all others, and achieves relative improvements of 52\% in splicing code quality and up to 22\% in classification error, compared with the state of the art. Novel combinations of regulatory features and novel combinations of tissues that share feature subgroups were identified using our method.Contact: frey@psi.toronto.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},
